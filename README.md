# Hough Line Transform
```
This project is trying to implement Line detection by using Hough Transform.
```
### Hough Line Transform
```
Input image 1: line.png
Input image 2: square.png

Command line: python hough_line_transform.py -i line.png
command line: python hough_line_transform.py -i square.png
```

* The program will show the result image as below:
