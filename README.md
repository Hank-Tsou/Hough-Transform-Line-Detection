# Hough Transform - Line Detection
#### a. Generate an image showing detected lines of the pool table overlaid on the top of the original image.

>>* (1) Readme_1_a.txt</br>
>>* (2) pool.jpg</br>
>>* (3) 1_a-1.py [ Use Hough Transform to detect lines on target edge image]</br>
>>* (4) 1_a-2.py [ Use Hough Transform to detect lines on target edge image and contour ]</br>
>>* (5) Four output images</br>

>>> <pre>Note: Each program can select one of the opencv function below:</br>" [1] cv2.HoughLines() " and " [2] cv2.HoughLinesP() "</br>--Therefore, there will have two output images for each program

>> #### (A) How to run the code [1_a-1.py]
>>> (a) Using the command prompt and direct to the file position. (my example)
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Yueh_Lin_Tsou_lab2\1\a]

>>> (b) input >> "python 1_a-1.py" to run the code.
>>> <pre> >> [C:\Users\hank\Desktop\Yueh_Lin_Tsou_lab2\1\a>python 1_a-1.py]

>>> (c) The program will ask to slecte one of the opencv function
>>> <pre> >> [(1) cv2.HoughLines (2) cv2.HoughLinesP: ]

>>> (d) The program will show the result image

>> #### (B) How to run the code [1_a-2.py]: Same as '1_a-1.py'
